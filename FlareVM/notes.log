4. Radare2 - A sophisticated open source platform for reverse engineering
5. Binary Ninja - tool for disassembling and decompiling binaries
6. PEID - packer, cryptor and compiler detection tool

-> Disassemblers & Decompilers
They help analysts understand malicious software's behaviour, logic, and control flow by breaking it into a more understandable format.

Tools: 
1. CFF Explorer - A PE editor designed to analyze and edit portable executable (PE) files
2. Hopper disassembler - a debugger, disassembler and decompiler
3. RetDec - open-source decompiler for machine code


-> Static & Dynamic Analysis
Static analysis involves inspecting the code without executing it, while dynamic analysis involves observing its behaviour as it runs

Tools:
1. Process Hacker - sophisticated memory editor and process watcher
2. PEView - protable executable file viewer for analysis
3. Dependency Walker - tool for displaying an executable's DLL dependencies
4. DIE (Detect it easy) - packer, compiler and cryptor detection tool



-> Forensics & Incident Response
Digital Forensics involves the collection, analysis, and preservation of digital evidence from various sources like computers, networks, and storage devices
Incident Response focuses on the detection, containment, eradication, and recovery from cyberattacks

tools:
1. Volatility - RAM dump analysis framework for memory forensics
2. Rekall - Framework for memory forensics in incident response
3. FTK Imager - Disc image acquisition and analysis tools for forensic use


-> Network Analysis
Network Analysis includes different methods and techniques for studying and analysing networks to uncover patterns, optimize performance, and understand the underlying structure and behaviour of the network.

Tools:
1. Wireshark
2. Nmap
3. Netcat


-> File Analysis
File Analysis is a technique used to examine files for potential security threats and ensure proper file permissions.

Tools:
1. FileInsight - program for looking through and editing binary files
2. Hex Fiend - Hex editor that is light and quick
3. HxD - Binary file viewing and editing with a hex editor


-> Scripting & Automation
Scripting and Automation involve using scripts such as PowerShell and Python to automate repetitive tasks and processes, making them more efficient and less prone to human error.



-> Sysinternals Suite
The Sysinternals Suite is a collection of advanced system utilities designed to help IT professionals and developers manage, troubleshoot, and diagnose Windows systems.

Tools:
1. Autoruns - shows what executables are configured to run during system boot-up
