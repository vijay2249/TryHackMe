question mentions something about steg -> which means storing data into other files - like into pictures..

first thing to use to do steganograpny is binwalk

"binwalk -e <picName>"
need password for zip file, use john the ripper to crack it

you will get some data -> decode with base64 -> you will get some more data

next use steghide extract -sf <otherPic> to extract data

enter password

read data from extracted file


do ssh and do the remaining drill

download image -> do reverse image search and filter to fox news

Good Work - with help nice things learned in the way
