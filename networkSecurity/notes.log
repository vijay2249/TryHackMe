whois -> query whois servers
nslookup -> query dns servers
dig -> query dns servers


whois records and dns records are publicly available records and hence do not alert the target


=============== Passive vs Active Recon
Reconnaissance (recon) can be defined as a preliminary survey to gather information about the target

=====> Passive Recon
Attacker rely on publicly available information without directly engaging with the target.
It may include activities like:
1. Looking DNS records of a domain
2. Checking job ads for tech stack and some extra information
3. News/updated information about what and how the target is working



=====> Actice Recon
Attacker engaging with the target.
Some of the examples include:
1. Connecting to one of the target servers such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP
2. Social Engineering
3. Entering target premises pretending to be repairman

=============== Whois
WHOIS is a request-response protocol that follows RFC-3912 specification.

WHOIS server listens on TCP port 43 for incoming requests. The domain registrar is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names its leasing.

cmd: whois <domainName>


=============== nslookup & dig
to find the IP address of the domain name, we use 'nslookup' command,

cmd: nslookup <options> <domainName> <server>

options - options for command
domainName - target domain
server - dns server that you want to query

for more advanced DNS queries and additional functionalities, we can use 'dig' command which is acronym for 'Domain Information Groper' 

cmd: dig @<server> <domainName> <DNSRecordType>



=============== DNSDumpster
DNS lookup tools (nslookup and dig) cannot find subdomain on their own

DNSDumpster - finds all the subdomains of a target and its related IP information and DNS information

=============== Shodan[.]io
When you are tasked to run a penetration test against specific targets, as part of the passive reconnaissance phase, a service like Shodan.io can be helpful to learn various pieces of information about the clientâ€™s network, without actively connecting to it.

Shodan[.]io tries to connect to every device reachable online to build a search engine of connected things in contrast with a search engine for web pages. Once it gets a response, it collects all the information related to the service and saves it in the database to make it searchable.
