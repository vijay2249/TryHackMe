Vulnerability scanning is the inspection of digital systems to find weakness.

Type of vuln scan:
1. Authenticated Scans
- The credentials of the subject host must be provided to the vulnerability scanner
- Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the attackers having access to the host.
- It provides a deeper visibility into the target system by scanning its configuration and installed applications.
2. Unauthenticated scans
- The vulnerability scanner does not require the hostâ€™s credentials; it only needs the IP address.
- Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an external attacker having no access to the subject host.
- It is less resource-intensive and straightforward to set up.

1. Internal Scan
- Conducted from inside the network.
- It focuses on the vulnerabilities that can be exploited inside the network.
- Identifies vulnerabilities that would be exposed to the attackers once they get inside the network.
2. External Scan
- Conducted from outside the network.
- It focuses on the vulnerabilities that can be exploited from outside the network.
- Identifies the vulnerabilities exposed to the attacker from outside the network.
