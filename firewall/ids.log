IDS - Intrusion Detection System

It only alerts the security system about the malicious activity but doesn't do anything to stop it.


IDS deployment modes
1. Host Intrusion detection system (HIDS)
- installed individually on the hosts and are responsible for only detecting potential security threats associated with that particular host.
- provide detailed visibility of the hosts activities.
- these are resource intensive and require management on each host

2. Network intrusion detection system (NIDS)
- detect malicious activities within the whole network regardless of any specific hosts. 
- provides a centralized view of all the detections inside the whole network.

-> Detection Modes
1. Signature based IDS
2. Anomaly based IDS
3. Hybrid IDS
