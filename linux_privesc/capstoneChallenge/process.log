ssh into target machine

=== Trail 1
check sudo permissions
cmd: sudo -l
  
failure 1

=== check for cronjobs

cmd: cat /etc/crontab

and the file is empty

failure 2


cmd: hostname


=== check /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow

/etc/passwd -> able to read
/etc/shadow -> permission denied

-> password cracking failed


=== history

this gives that flag2.txt is present in /home/rootflag folder
and there is another user "missy"


=== Enum with enum4Linux
failed
found nothing


=== Enum with linpeas and linEnum, lse

starting with LinEnum.sh
-> 
-> we have SUID set for /usr/bin/base64 program, lets test to see whether we can display contents of /etc/shadow

boom -> able to display contents of /etc/shadow file

now unshadow /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow

and crack password with John The Ripper

get missy password -> find flag1.txt location -> and cat the contents


Now for flag2 -> search for flag2.txt with missy as user -> no luck -> maybe permission denied 

check for flag2.txt file from leonard user -> still no luck -> now either its root or check for another user if any in the system 

to check users -> check contents of /etc/passwd file

but from the directories in the its root user we need to get permissions to

john is unable to crack root password from /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files contents


-> once again lets go back to linEnum enum
-> nothing new apart from SUID base64


=== checked for NFS volumes
cmd: showmount -e <IP>

-> no luck


=== `sudo -l` over missy user
this shows that missy can run find command with root privileges


now lets check if we have any option to enumerate this sudo privilege by searching GTFOBins for any commands

-> run the command `sudo find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit`

and there we go, a root shell

And there we go for flag2.txt contents


================ And we conclude the Linux Privilege Escalation Room
