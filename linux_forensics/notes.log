=== Linux Forensics
Linux is very light-weight and can run on very low resources

Its modular in nature and can be customized as per requirements of user or enterprise


=== OS and Account Information
In linux, everything is stored in a file and everything is considered as a file.

## OS Information
More information about the os release it can be found in `/etc/os-release` file location - cat the contents and check the version of the os

## User Accounts
file `/etc/passwd` file contains information about the user accounts that exists on the machine

The file contains 7 colon separated fields, describing username, password information, user id(uid), group id (gid), description, home directory information, and the default shell that executes when the user logs in.

-> User created accounts have uids >=1000.

NOTE: cool trick -> use column command to display content in table format (check man pages for column command for more info)

## Group Information
the file `/etc/group` contains information abou the different user groups present on the host.

## Sudoers List
A linux host allow only those users to elevate privileges to "sudo", which are present in the sudoers list that are mentioned in `/etc/sudoers` file path

Also as an example, the user needs to be sudoer to actually read the contents of this file


## Login Information
the file `/var/log/btmp` saves information about the failed logins
the file `/var/log/wtmp` keeps historical data of logins

- These files are binary files which means that they cant display content directly with cat command
- for these specific files we can user last command
cmd: sudo last -f /var/log/wtmp


## Authentication Logs
- Every yser that authenticates on a linux host is logged in the file `/var/log/auth.log` 
- It can be read using the 'cat' command


=== System Configuration
## Hostname
the hostname is stpred in the `/etc/hostname` file on a linux host - use cat cmd to display content


## Timezone
timezone of the system/host - present in location `/etc/timezone` - use cat cmd to display content


## Network Configuration
- the info about the linux network interfaces - present in location `/etc/network/interfaces` - use cat cmd to display content

- similarly we can use 'ip' command to get info about system's IP and MAC address of differnet interfaces.


## Active network connections
- use 'netstat' utility to find active network connections on a linux host 
cmd: netstat -natp


## Running Processes
- 'ps' command shows details abou the running processes - if no arguments mentioned then it shows only user started processes
cmd: ps aux #this will show all process on host


## DNS information
- the file `/etc/hosts` contains the configurations for the DNS name assignment. - use 'cat' cmd to display content
- the information about DBS servers that a linux hosts talks to for DNS resolution are stored in `/etc/resolv.conf` file - use 'cat' cmd to display content


=== Persistence mechanisms
Persistence mechanisms are ways a program can survice after a system reboot.


## Cron jobs
- cron jobs are commands that run periodically after a set amount of time.
- these are mentioned in file `/etc/crontab` - use 'cat' cmd to display contents


## Service Startup
- services can be set up in linux that will start and run in the background after every system boot. 
- these list of services can be found in `/etc/init.d` directory 


## .bashrc
- When a bash shell is spawned, it runs the commands stored in the `~/.bashrc` file. 
- This file can be considered as a startup list of actions to be performed.

- system wide settings are stored in `/etc/bash.bashrc` and `/etc/profile` files.


=== Evidence of Execution

## Sudo execution history
- all the commands that are run on a linux host using 'sudo' are stored in `auth.log` file.


## Bash History
- any commands other than the ones run using 'sudo' are stored in bash history file.
- file location: `~/.bash_history`
- every user's bash history is stored separately in that user's home folder


## Files accessed using vim
- the vim text editor stores logs for opened files in vim in the file named `.viminfo` in the home directory
- this file contains command line history, search string history etc. for the opened files using vim



=== Log files
Logs are generally found in the `/var/log` directory


## Syslog
- contains messages that are recorded by host about system activity. the detail which is recorded in these messages is configurable through the logging level
- file location: `/var/log/syslog` - use cat cmd to display contents
- the log line displays - system time, system name, the process that sent the log [the process id], and the details of the log.


## Auth logs
`/var/log/auth.log` file logs


## Third party logs
Similar to the syslog and authentication logs, the /var/log/ directory contains logs for third-party applications such as webserver, database, or file share server logs.
