Tcpdump tool and its 'libpcap' library are written in C and C++ and were released on Unix like systems


while using tcpdump we can specify which network interface to listen to using '-i' flag, we can listen to all interfaces via 'any' value to -i flag

-w <file> -> save the output to a file (the common notation for file extension is .txt )
-r <file> -> read the data from file
-c <count> -> number of packets to capture 

Tcpdump will resolve IP addresses and print friendly domain names where possible.

To avoid making such DNS lookups, you can use the -n argument
we can use -nn argument - to avoid resolving both DNS and port numbers

You can easily limit the captured packets to this host using host IP or host HOSTNAME

It is important to note that capturing packets requires you to be logged-in as root or to use sudo.


If you want to limit the packets to those from a particular source IP address or hostname, you must use 'src host IP' or 'src host HOSTNAME'. Similarly, you can limit packets to those sent to a specific destination using 'dst host IP' or 'dst host HOSTNAME'.

If you want to capture all DNS traffic, you can limit the captured packets to those on 'port 53'
