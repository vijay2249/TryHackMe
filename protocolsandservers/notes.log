=== TELNET
application layer protocol
Using Telnet, a user can log into another computer and access its terminal (console) to run programs, start batch processes, and perform system administration tasks remotely.

unencrypted connection

default port is 23


=== Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
Email delivery over the internet requires the following components:
1. Mail Submission Agent (MSA)
2. Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)
3. Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)
4. Mail User Agent (MUA)


MUA (an email client) has email to send -> MUA connects to a MSA to send its message -> MSA checks for any errors before transmitting to MTA -> MTA will send email msg to MTA of receipent -> a typical setup would have the MTA server also functioning as a MDA -> MDA sends email to receipent user

SMTP uses cleartext, where all commands are sent without encryption,

default port: 25


=== Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)

used to download email messages from a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) server.
the mail client connects to the POP3 server, authenticates, downloads the new email messages before (optionally) deleting them

default port: 110


=== Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
More sophisticated than POP3
tool behind keeping email synchronized across multiple devices
default port: 143

IMAP requires each command to be preceded by a random string to be able to track the reply
